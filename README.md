Welcome to the **Bayesian Statistics and Bayesian Inference** course! This course is designed to provide a deep understanding of Bayesian inference, probability distributions, and real-world applications.

When observing data, the key question is: What I can learn from the observation? Bayesian inference treats all parameters of the model as random variables. The main task is to update their distribution as new data is observed. Hence, quantifying uncertainty of the parameter estimation is always part of the task. In this course we will introduce the basic theoretical concepts of Bayesian Statistics and Bayesian inference. We discuss the computational techniques and their implementations, different types of models as well as model selection procedures. We will exercise on the existing datasets use the PyMC framework for practicals.

## ðŸŽ¯ Topics
- Bayes theorem
- Prior and Posterior distributions
- Computational challenges and techniques: MCMC, variational approaches
- PyMC framework for Bayesian computation

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
Participants should be familiar with general statistical concepts, such as distributions, samples. Furthermore, familiarity with fundamental Machine Learning concepts such as regression, classification and training is helpful.
